* transfer-sh.el
  This package provides an interface for uploading data to transfer.sh
  directly from within Emacs.

  This package was originally created by S. Roskamp
  <steffen.roskamp@gmail.com> (see original repository [[https://github.com/SRoskamp/transfer-sh.el][here]]).

** Installation
   The package is available in the [[http://www.melpa.org][MELPA]] repository: =M-x
   package-install= and =transfer-sh=. Alternatively, you can clone
   this repository.


** Usage
   An upload can be performed by selecting the region/buffer to upload
   and then executing one of the following commands:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; This simply uploads the selected text to transfer-sh and returns
  ;; the link
  transfer-sh-upload

  ;; Use this to encrypt files before uploading. It will prompt you
  ;; for a passcode to pass to gpg.
  transfer-sh-upload-gpg
   #+END_SRC

   When called with the universal prefix argument (C-u), the upload
   will be done asynchronously. This prevents emacs from locking while
   uploading large files. This functionality requires the [[https://github.com/jwiegley/emacs-async][async.el]]
   package to be installed.
